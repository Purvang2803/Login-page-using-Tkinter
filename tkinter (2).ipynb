    "### Observation:  \n",
    "The function `connect_db()` is responsible for establishing a connection to an SQLite database stored at a specific path. It ensures that a table named `users` is created if it does not already exist. The table consists of four fields: `username` (set as the primary key), `email`, `phone`, and `password`, all stored as `TEXT` data types. The function properly commits the changes and closes the database connection after execution. However, the database path is hardcoded, which can reduce the flexibility and portability of the application.  \n",

    "The implementation effectively ensures that the database and user table exist before performing any operations, preventing potential table duplication errors. However, using a relative path or allowing the user to specify the database location would improve flexibility. Additionally, implementing a `try-except` block to handle potential database connection errors would enhance the robustness of the function."
